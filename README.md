Fix-Outlook-Shared-Sent
=======================

Issue: An email sent from a shared mailbox in Outlook appears in the users sent items instead of the shared mailboxesâ€™ shared items.

Solution: Close Outlook, run this script, then open Outlook.

It will work for both Outlook 2010 (14) and Outlook 2013 (15).
